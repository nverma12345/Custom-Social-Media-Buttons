# Custom-Social-Media-Buttons
I am currently working on, the client wanted more advanced insight into where their traffic was coming from and, more specifically, if people were arriving from links shared via the social media share buttons on the website.

To do this, I created some custom social media share buttons that were lightweight, scriptless, and included tracking information for google analytics.
